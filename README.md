- [Read a TBA address + create-wagmi](https://github.com/anggxyz/tb-sdk-demo-create-wagmi): A NextJS app scaffolded with [create-wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/cli/create-wagmi) that computes and displays a TBA associated with an NFT
- [Deploy a tokenbound account](https://github.com/anggxyz/tb-deploy-demo): typescript scripts to deploy a tokenbound account and move assets between a main account and a TBA
- [vite-wagmi-viem](https://github.com/tokenbound/sdk/tree/main/examples/vite-wagmi-viem): This is a wagmi + viem + ConnectKit + Vite project bootstrapped with create-wagmi
- [vite-wagmi-ethers](https://github.com/tokenbound/sdk/tree/main/examples/vite-wagmi-ethers): This is a wagmi + ConnectKit + Vite project bootstrapped with create-wagmi
- [vite-wagmi-ethers6](https://github.com/tokenbound/sdk/tree/main/examples/vite-wagmi-ethers6): This is a wagmi + ConnectKit + Vite project bootstrapped with create-wagmi,it implements the Ethers v6 signer using viem's Ethers.js adapters in the useEthersSigner hook.
- [vite-wagmi-ethers-rainbowkit](https://github.com/tokenbound/sdk/tree/main/examples/vite-wagmi-ethers-rainbowkit): This is a wagmi + RainbowKit + Vite project bootstrapped with create-wagmi. It implements the Ethers v5 signer using viem's Ethers.js adapters in the useEthersSigner hook.
